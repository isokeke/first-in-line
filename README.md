# first-in-line
The purpose of this tool is to allow the user to navigate to a specific URL at a specific time. This tool is helpful in situations where a service opens at a given time, e.g. course registrations, festival ticket sales or any other acitivities that require navigation at a specific time. 

For example, if a ticket sale starts at 08:00:00, you can set this tool to automatically navigate to the given URL when the clock turns 08:00:00. Especially useful for situation where a user has to navigate to several websites simultaneously (e.g. registrating to several courses).
